I'm a technical specialist and industrial PhD at [Zeekr Technology Europe](https://www.zeekrtech.eu/), affiliated with the Automatic Control research group at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). My journey in the automotive industry started right after my master's graduation, where I began as a Battery Software Engineer at [National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS)](https://www.nevs.com/). Since then, I've worn multiple hats—from Software Engineer to System Engineer, Validation Engineer, and Technical Specialist—all in the electrifying world of battery technology.

My passion lies in the intersection of data science and battery technology. I specialize in leveraging data-driven methods for battery aging diagnostics and prognostics. I'm particularly fascinated by how smart analytics can help understand, predict, and ultimately extend the lifespan of traction batteries for electrified vehicles and battery energy storage systems. Through my research and projects, I aim to push the boundaries of battery performance and help pave the way for more sustainable, efficient mobility and energy storage solutions.

I thrive on solving real-world challenges with innovative technology, and I love exploring new ways to make batteries not only last longer but also work smarter.
